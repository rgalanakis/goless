"""
goless provides Golang semantics built on top of
gevent, PyPy, or Stackless Python.
Use goless.chan to create a synchronous or buffered channel.
Use goless.go to start a goroutine.
Use goless.select like you would Go's reflect.Select function,
with goless.dcase, rcase, and scase.

goless is fully documented, tested, and has many examples.
See http://goless.readthedocs.org/ for more documentation.
